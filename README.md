## Setup

To set up the requirements, open a terminal in the root directory and
run the following command (optionally while inside a virtual environment):

```pip install -r requirements.txt```


## Run

Once you have the requirements installed, run the following command to start the website in development mode:

```python start.py```

Then visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the website. Changes to the project files should take effect immediately 
(you'll still need to refresh the page to view the new changes).
