You would then spread peanut butter on the slices, and finally spread the jelly on the slices as well. It wouldn't make much sense to start by spreading the jelly before getting the two slices of bread. You have to do each step in a particular order to make the sandwich. When you program, you are explaining to a computer what steps to perform and in what order to complete some task. \n                            \nProgramming is where a programmer (you) writes a program (a set of instructions) that a computer can perform. But how does the computer understand your program? Computers at their lowest level do not understand human language. They instead rely on 1s and 0s in order to do everything. Writing 1s and 0s to program would be tedious, confusing, and limiting for a programmer, so we instead use what are called programming languages. \n                      \nA programming language defines keywords, strings, and commands that can be written by a programmer and transformed into code that a computer can understand. Over the course of these modules, you will learn one of these programming languages, Python, but there are dozens more, each with their own strengths and drawbacks.",
