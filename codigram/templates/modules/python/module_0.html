					<h2 class="text-center p-2"> Defining Programming </h2>
					<p > Think about how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
						You would probably start by getting two slices of bread. You would then spread peanut butter on the slices, 
						and finally spread the jelly on the slices as well. It wouldn't make much sense to start by spreading the 
						jelly before getting the two slices of bread. You have to do each step in a particular order to make the
						sandwich. When you program, you are explaining to a computer what steps to perform and in what order to
						complete some task. 
						<br><br>
						Programming is where a programmer (you) writes a program (a set of instructions) that a computer can
						execute. But how does the computer understand your program? Computers at their lowest level
						do not understand human language. They instead rely on 1s and 0s in order to do everything. Writing 1s and 0s
						to program would be tedious, confusing, and limiting for a programmer, so we instead use what are called programming languages.  
						<br><br>
						A programming language defines keywords, strings, and commands that can be written by a programmer and transformed into code 
						that a computer can understand. Over the course of these modules, you will learn one of these programming languages, Python,
						but there are dozens more, each with their own strengths and drawbacks.

					<h2 class="text-center"> Applications of Programming </h2>
					<p> What exactly can you do with programming? The possibilities grow every day as technology improves, but almost anything you do with
						your computer, your tablet, or your phone is enabled by programming. Programming allows you to play videogames, check the weather, write emails,
						and view this very webpage. Programming is used for robotics, animation, communication, manufacturing, and in every 
					industry that uses computers.  </p>

					<p> At the end of each module, you will find a button that says complete. Clicking it completes the module and returns you to the modules page.
						You can return to any completed module at any time. Some modules may be more than one page, so this button will instead
					say continue. </p>
