                    <p>In the previous module, you learned that a programming language is a computer language that both humans and computers
                        can understand. There are many programming languages out there, including Python. Python is known for being particularly
                        easy to understand and learn. The language was first developed in the 1980s and is one of the most popular
                    programming languages today. To get to know it better, let's jump into your first coding activity! </p>
