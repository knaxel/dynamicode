            "text": "In the previous module, you wrote a program that produced an output of the phrase “Hello World!”. You accomplished this by using what is called a print statement. Although called different things across different languages, a print statement is a standard function that prints any words, phrases, or sentences to some sort of output interface, such as a terminal. Throughout these modules, any output produced by print statements can be seen in the box below where you type code. The format for using a print statement is always the same: type `print(‘’)` and put whatever you would like to print in between the quotes. Almost anything with quotes around in it is considered a String in python, but we will explain this in further detail in a future module. You can also print things like numbers with or without quotes, such as by typing `print()` and putting a number in between the parentheses. This will not work for words. Print statements are incredibly useful for giving programs a way of producing output that is meaningful to the programmer or a user.",

            "name": "Python Syntax",
            "text": "Syntax is a set of rules that govern the structure and usage of symbols, words, and code layout in a programming language. In many languages for example, every line of code must end with a semicolon. However, this is not true in Python. Python uses indentation to denote blocks of code. For example, take a look at the code below:   \n\n    if x < 0:    \n        print(“X is less than zero”)       \n    print(“Next line”)     \n\nNote how the second line is indented compared to the first. That line of code will only execute if x is less than zero, whereas the line `print(“Next line”)` will always run because it is not indented, and thus not a part of that block of code.    \n***\nPython is also quite lenient when it comes to declaring variables, which you will explore in the next module. For example, in many languages, declaring a variable requires some kind of keyword, such as var. In Python, no keywords are necessary. Variables can be declared by writing the name of a variable and setting it equal to a value, like:    \n\n    x = 0\n    y = “this is a string”\n    z = True    \n\nBehind the scenes, Python will decide what kind of variable each declaration is. Note that variable names are case-sensitive, variable names cannot be a keyword, and String variables can be declared using single or double quotes.    \n",
