You’ve already learned a bit about strings from the last module but to go into further detail, strings are words, phrases or sentences that are bracketed by either the double quotes or the single quotes (ex: “Hi”, ‘Welcome’, “Come on in”). Ints and floats are similar in that they both store numbers but what makes them different is that ints store whole numbers while floats store decimal numbers. So the number 15 would be an int but the number 8.5 would be a float. While the other variable types can have a range of values, the boolean type can only have two: True or False. ",

For example, if you were to simply type `x = False`, Python knows right away that the variable x is a boolean with a value of False.",

One naming convention is called camelCase. As the name shows, the first letter of the word is lowercase but every word after that has a capital first letter. A more common naming convention in Python is separating each word of the variable by an underscore (ex: `my_variable = “underscores”`). This is more commonly used because the underscore acts as a blank space between words which allows readers to quickly understand the variable name.\n*** \nRegardless of what way you name your variables, the most important rule is to make sure to name them according to what they are being used for. For example, say I want to make a variable to keep track of how many times I print something. Although naming it something as simple as x may be nice and quick, further down the line when you want to revisit the variable it may be harder to find, especially if there are many lines of code. So in order to prevent confusion or stress in the future, you should name the variable something like counter. This will not only make it easier to find the specific variable but it will also allow others reading your code to quickly realize that this variable is being used to count something.",
