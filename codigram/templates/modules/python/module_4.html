            "text": "Math is an essential part of coding that makes many software solutions possible. Not all mathematical functions are supported by default, but the ones that you are most familiar with are. Say we have a variable called counter and it’s set to 0. How could we set it to 1? We could do `counter = 1`, but as you may have guessed from the variable name, we want to increase its value regularly. This is where arithmetic operators come in, which allow for the most basic mathematical functions to be used. Instead of saying `counter = 1`, we can say `counter = counter + 1`. Now the value will always increase by 1 no matter what it was set to before. There are other shorthand ways of doing addition as well. For example, we could also say `counter+=1`. This also works for other operators - for example, we can say `counter = counter - 1` or `counter-=1` for subtraction. The operator for multiplication is `*` and the operator for division is `/`.    \n***\nPython also has several operators that you may be unfamiliar with. The first is `%`, which is called a modulus. The modulus operator divides one number by another, and returns the remainder. For example, 5 % 4 is equal to 1 because 4 goes into 5 once, and 1 is the remainder. The next operator is `**`, which represents an exponent. 2**2, for example, is 4. The final operator is `//`, which is for floor division. We’ll go into more detail in the next section.    \n***\nIt’s important to note that the results of performing arithmetic with floats is different from with integers. For example, 3.0 * 3 is equal to 9.0, but 3 * 3 is 9.   \n",

If we divided like usual by using `/`, we would have a/b = 0.75. However, we might not want a decimal number as our output. Say we only wanted integers (whole numbers) - we could say a//b = 0.0. The `//` operator performs floor division, which takes the result of a regular division and rounds it down (hence the use of the word floor). If the result was negative, the result would be rounded down away from zero, whereas a positive result would be rounded down towards zero. So -1.4 would be rounded to -2 and 1.4 would be rounded to 1.",

For example, we already saw that the way to assign a value to a variable is by using the equals sign. We also use some of these operators for building strings. Let’s consider the following variables.   \n    \n    a = “Hello”   \n    b = “ World!”   \n    \nWe can use the addition operator to append the word world to hello. So if we did `a = a + b`, we would get “Hello World!”. You cannot mix and match adding numbers and strings. For example, 1 + “2” will only result in an error.\n",
