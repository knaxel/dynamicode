For example, a weather app will want to display that it’s snowing, raining, or sunny depending on the actual weather. So we use what are called conditionals, which are commands and statements that direct a program to a certain output depending on a certain input.",

These operators are > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to), == (equal to), and != (not equal to). Each of these operators require two values that are compared to each other using the operator. For example, if we compared 5 and 3 with the greater than operator, we would have 5 > 3 which is true. If we compared 7 and 9 with the equal to operator, we would have 7==9 which is false, but with the not equal to operator, we have 7!=9 which is true. These operators can compare variables to different kinds of values, including integers, strings, and booleans, in order to change the flow of the program.",

Say it’s the variable x and it can be any number, positive or negative. We can write an if statement as shown.    \n        \n         if x > 0:    \n            print(“X is greater than zero”)    \n         print(“Next line”)    \n          \nWhen x is greater than zero, the conditional statement is true, and so the print statement that is indented will run. If x is not greater than zero, the print statement that is indented will not run and will instead be ignored. The next print statement will run regardless of if x is greater than zero because it is not within the scope of the if statement, as it is not indented.   \n***\nWhat if we want to use multiple conditions in the same if statement? Say we have another variable y and we want print(“X is greater than zero”) to only run if both x and y are greater than zero. We can use the and keyword as shown:   \n       \n        if (x > 0 and y > 0):    \n            print(“X is greater than zero”)    \n        print(“Next line”)    \n        \nIt’s good practice to wrap multiple conditional statements in parentheses, especially when you have more than two or when you have conditional statements used inside other conditional statements. \nWhat if we want the print statement to run if at least one of the statements is true? We can use the or keyword as shown:    \n         \n        if (x > 0 or y > 0):    \n            print(“X is greater than zero”)    \n        print(“Next line”)    \n        \nWhat if we want the print statement to run if x is not greater than zero? As an alternative to using a different operator, we can use the not keyword as shown:    \n        \n        if not x > 0:     \n\t        print(“X is greater than zero”)     \n        print(“Next line”)    \n       ",

However, this single conditional does not cover all the possible values x can take on. Perhaps we want our code to do other things if x is less than zero, or equal to 0. We can use a if-elif-else statement to accomplish this. Say we want to print a certain statement if x > 0 and another only if x is less than or equal to zero. We can write the following code:    \n     \n        if(x>0):      \n\t        print(“X is greater than zero”)     \n        else:     \n\t       print(“X is not greater than zero”)    \n      \nWe use the else keyword for all cases not covered by the conditional statement in the if statement. If we wanted to run a line of code only if z is equal to zero, we could add the elif keyword:     \n       \n        if(x>0):     \n\t        print(“X is greater than zero”)     \n        elif(x==0):     \n\t        print(“X is equal to zero”)     \n        else:      \n\t        print(“X is not greater than zero”)     \n     \nWhenever we have multiple cases, we use if for the first and elif for the rest, while else is for all cases not covered by those statements.\n",
