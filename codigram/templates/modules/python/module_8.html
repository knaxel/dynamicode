You may want your program to take input from a user and then print relevant information based on this input. You can use the input() function as shown to allow users to type anything as input:    \n     \n        x = input()        \n        \nIf you want to add a prompt, you can add text in-between the parentheses:        \n        \n        x = input(‘What’s your name? Type here: ’)        \n",

            "text": "A user’s input will often need to show up in some way in output. If the input was a string, we can also concatenate it to other strings in a print statement like shown:       \n       \n       name = input()       \n       print(“Hi “ + name)       \n       \nThere are much fancier ways of doing this that are useful for non-string values as well. Take a look at the following code.       \n       \n       x = “World!”       \n       print(f ‘Hello {x}’)       \n       \nLet’s break this down. We start by declaring a string variable called x whose value is “World!” We then have a print statement which holds a string preceded by the character ‘f’. The f character is used to make the string inside the print statement a formatted string literal. By doing so, we can place variable names inside brackets to easily add them to the print statement, as shown above.\nNow take a look at this block of code.       \n       \n       name = “George”       \n       print(“Hi, my name is {0}”.format(name))       \n       \nWe can use the format method to insert values into strings just like with the formatted string variables. Instead of putting the variable name in brackets, you put the index of the entry in the format method. For example, if we had `.format(name, age)` instead, we would use {0} to insert the name and {1} to insert the age.",

Add prompts so that each value the user inputs is only a specific type of word - the first and fourth inputs should be adjectives, the second and fifth inputs should be colors, and the third and sixth inputs should be nouns.
